Finite impulse response --> 0 to finite ammount of time
Nyquist frequenbcy --> minimum rate at whitch signal can be sampled without introducing error

1. firls Linear-phase FIR filter design using least-squares error minimization
2.a length N+1 linear phase
3.FIR filter which has the best approximation to the
    desired frequency response described by F and A in the least squares
    sense
4. F is a vector of frequency band edges in pairs, in ascending
    order between 0 and 1.
5. 1 corresponds to the Nyquist frequency or half
    the sampling frequency
6. A is a real vector the same size as F
    which specifies the desired amplitude of the frequency response of the
    resultant filter B

 fir1   FIR filter design using the window method.
    B = fir1(N,Wn) designs an N'th order lowpass FIR digital filter
    and returns the filter coefficients in length N+1 vector B.
    The cut-off frequency Wn must be between 0 < Wn < 1.0, with 1.0
    corresponding to half the sample rate.  The filter B is real and
    has linear phase.  The normalized gain of the filter at Wn is
    -6 dB.
 
    B = fir1(N,Wn,'high') designs an N'th order highpass filter.
    You can also use B = fir1(N,Wn,'low') to design a lowpass filter.

order means maximum delay in samples
